## How do I use this?

This *should* be easy if you know how to manage Composer and Laravel:

1. Install Composer, Git, and PHP if you don't have them.  
   If you use Windows or macOS, try [Herd](https://herd.laravel.com).

2. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/randomyaps/finobe-laravel
   ```

3. Go into the cloned folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Edit the `.env.example` file in your text editor (Sublime Text, VS Code, etc.),  
   then **save it as `.env`** instead of `.env.example`.

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   **PS:** Make sure you have MySQL installed and configured properly.

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
