                        <li><strong>We store your IP address and e-mail address.</strong> We might use it as a unique identifier. We won't give it away.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your password is hashed. No, we don't give it away.</strong> Blowfish is cool.</li>
                        <li><strong>We use cookies.</strong> If you disable them, the site will break in half. So don't. <small>I mean, you can, but the site won't work.</small></li>
                        <li><strong>We use Google Analytics and have ads.</strong> We send the Google people your user ID whenever you visit the site, unless you have an ad blocker.</li>
                        <li>Our server location varies, if that matters at all. It could be hosted in Europe one day, and a random country like Romania the next day. We aren't a corporation. This is considered <del>a side-project</del> an educational project of the creator.</li>
                        <li>In the event of a data breach, we'll have a notice up. We also might send out an e-mail if we have the funds for that (because bulk e-mails are expensive).</li>
                        <li>In the event we <i>do</i> show something that contains your e-mail or IP address in public, it will be fully or partially blurred.</li>
                        <li>When you play, a unique identifier may be created.</li>
                        <li>We don't sell your info to third-parties.</li>
                        <li>Many actions on the Finobe website are logged. For example, selling a item. They may be visible to staff members, and may contain information like your IP address and username.</li>
                        <li>We use Cloudflare! That means everything you do goes through them.</li>
                        <li>GDPR is trash. If you are in Europe, don't use the site. Or do, but don't cry to us with a GDPR email because we won't respond.</li>
                        <li>To explain that last point, <strong>we do not delete accounts for any reason.</strong></li>

                    <p class="mb-0">This page (and its contents) may change without any notice, at any time. <small>Buuuuuut if we figure out bulk e-mails and feel nice we might send an e-mail out about a change.</small></p>
